        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>0.75 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>0.5 cup milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>0.3 cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter in a different bowl. Keep separate until ready to cook.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Pour mixtures together, mixing with wooden spoon or fork until blended. Batter should be a bit lumpy.</li>
            <li>Pour or Scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle using ~0.5 cups for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface (~1-2 minutes). Flip and cook until brown on the other side.</li>
            <li>Serve and Enjoy</li>
        </ol>
